# L.O.V.E-club-Website
Website for L.O.V.E club - Latino Organization for Volunteering in Education

The Website was created so that the Latino Community of Columbus East High School could access our club events and opportunities through a simple website that organized everything important in one place, instead of the subdivided pieces we usually have on social media.
